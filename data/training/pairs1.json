    {
        "question": "What is the full causal chain that caused EVEQUE to enter the BROKEN state, citing all relevant timestamps and abilities used?",
        "answer": "The chain begins when OVERCHARGE was selected at [04:08] and applied at maximum charge 10/10 at [04:10]. According to the causal links, this directly leads to the BROKEN status appearing at [04:13]. The sequence is: Select OVERCHARGE → Apply 10/10 Overcharge → BROKEN at [04:13]."
    },
    {
        "question": "How do the visual indicators of STAINS at [01:02] correlate with the later healing event at [02:00]?",
        "answer": "STAINS are shown at [01:02] as a result of casting skills. The causal links show that STAINS accumulation at [118.1s] contributes to the Perfect Heal effect at [120.1s], which aligns with the +65 recovery at [02:00]. The sequence is: STAINS buildup → Trigger healing interaction → +65 heal event."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why does IMMOLATION at [01:52] represent an escalating threat, and how does its Burn stacks interact with the RECOVERY mechanic shown at [01:24]?",
        "answer": "IMMOLATION at [01:52] applies 3 Burn stacks. Since RECOVERY at [01:24] is described as clearing negative effects, the escalating threat is that Burn deals ongoing damage until removed. The causal reasoning is: IMMOLATION applies Burn → Burn persists → RECOVERY dispels status if used promptly."
    },
    {
        "question": "Based on the dialogue where Lune shouts 'Fall back!' at [00:21], how does this align with the visual detection of a large enemy at [00:17]?",
        "answer": "The statement 'Fall back!' at [00:21] responds to the visual confirmation at [00:17] that the enemy is large ('Fuck, it's big'). Speech and visual modalities align: Large threat detected → Player ordered to reposition."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does Gustave’s line 'Putain de merde!' at [00:25] relate to the health bar appearance for EVEQUE at [00:37]?",
        "answer": "Gustave's exclamation at [00:25] conveys alarm immediately before EVEQUE's boss health bar appears at [00:37]. The emotional speech reflects recognition of an imminent boss encounter confirmed visually moments later."
    },
    {
        "question": "Explain how the repeated Parry indicators between [00:43] and [00:45] demonstrate a defensive mechanic and why this likely precedes EVEQUE’s spell cast at [00:41].",
        "answer": "The spell cast at [00:41] triggers defensive reactions. The Parry indicators at [00:43] and [00:45] reflect attempts to negate or reduce damage. The sequence is: Spell detected → Player performs consecutive Parries to mitigate impact."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the SHIELDS mechanic displayed at [00:55] imply for the player’s damage strategy when STAINS appear at [00:59]?",
        "answer": "SHIELDS at [00:55] indicate damage mitigation. STAINS at [00:59] arrive from skill casting. Together, the player must break shields first while managing STAINS buildup. The strategy: Remove shields → Optimize damage → Manage STAINS."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the +65 'Perfect!' healing event at [02:00] causally linked to selecting HEALING LIGHT at [01:56]?",
        "answer": "The causal links state: Selecting Heal at [116.1s] leads to the Perfect Heal at [120.1s]. In the timeline, HEALING LIGHT appears at [01:56], followed by +65 Perfect heal at [02:00]. Thus: Skill selected → Healing resolves as Perfect."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why does the Enraged warning at [04:27] increase the danger level when combined with the Weakness 403 indicator at [04:25]?",
        "answer": "Weakness appears at [04:25], showing the enemy is vulnerable. Two seconds later, EVEQUE becomes Enraged at [04:27], meaning increased damage output. The danger rises because the enemy is both wounded and transitioning into aggressive behavior."
    },
    {
        "question": "Explain how the command 'Select target.' at [03:38] corresponds to the Parry+Dodge sequence at [03:44].",
        "answer": "The target selection event at [03:38] indicates player action. Immediately after, the enemy answers with Parry+Dodge at [03:44], demonstrating reactive AI behavior: Player commits to attack → Enemy responds defensively."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why does the Parry at [02:13] followed by PERFECT Parry at [02:15] indicate a mastery mechanic?",
        "answer": "The timeline shows escalating precision: Parry at [02:13] → PERFECT Parry at [02:15]. The causal links suggest combat accuracy improves outcomes. Thus, PERFECT Parry implies the highest timing accuracy within the mechanic."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the 'Eveque summons minions.' event at [03:10] combine with STAINS at [03:20] to increase the combat complexity?",
        "answer": "Summoning at [03:10] adds enemies, while STAINS at [03:20] indicate resource buildup from casting. More enemies + escalating STAINS means higher pressure. Causally: Summons → More actions required → STAINS accumulate during combat."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the repeated '5/10' charge indicator between [05:56] and [06:10] suggest about EVEQUE's Overcharge buildup?",
        "answer": "The repeated 5/10 indicators show charge progression toward Overcharge. Since Overcharge at 10/10 previously caused BROKEN at [04:13], the 5/10 readings imply mid-cycle buildup toward another potential burst."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the IMMOLATION at [05:22] relate to the 'Eveque burns.' text at [05:28]?",
        "answer": "IMMOLATION at [05:22] applies burn effects. The causal links confirm casting IMMOLATION leads to burning damage. Thus: IMMOLATION → Burn ticks → 'Eveque burns.' displayed at [05:28]."
    },
    {
        "question": "Given the boss reached BROKEN at [04:13], what immediate follow-up attack should the player use based on high-damage skills shown earlier?",
        "answer": "Since BROKEN removes defenses at [04:13], the player should immediately use LUMIERE ASSAULT demonstrated at [01:32] because it is a multi-hit physical skill optimized for exploiting BROKEN windows."
    },
    {
        "question": "Based on the Enraged warning at [04:27], what defensive preparation should the player prioritize?",
        "answer": "Enraged increases boss output. The player should prepare a RECOVERY action referencing [01:24], which dispels negative effects, or maintain Parry chains like those at [00:43] and [00:45] to mitigate incoming heavy hits."
    },
    {
        "question": "How should the player react to the minion attack on Lune at [03:54]?",
        "answer": "Since Lune is attacked at [03:54], the player should either: heal Lune using SMALL HEALING TINT from [01:28], or apply counterattacks shown in Gustave attacks at [03:03]."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the best response when EVEQUE 'charges up' at [04:49]?",
        "answer": "Charging at [04:49] indicates a strong upcoming attack. The player should stack Parry attempts based on prior successful Parries at [02:13], [02:15], and [03:44], anticipating a heavy telegraphed hit."
    },
    {
        "question": "What should the player do after 'Eveque attacks Gustave' at [04:39] reduces Gustave’s stability?",
        "answer": "Since Gustave is hit at [04:39] and RECOVERY is known to restore 50 HP at [01:24], the player should deploy RECOVERY immediately to prevent Gustave from being dropped in the next Enraged cycle."
    },
    {
        "question": "Given STAINS appear repeatedly between [03:20] and [05:54], what is the recommended long-term strategy?",
        "answer": "STAINS accumulate steadily from [03:20] to [05:54]. Since STAINS come from casting skills, the strategy is to moderate casting frequency to avoid triggering unintended effects while maintaining offensive pressure."
    },
    {
        "question": "What action should the player take when EVEQUE reaches 87/187 HP at [06:04]?",
        "answer": "At 87/187 HP, EVEQUE is low. The player should use high burst options like OVERCHARGE (demonstrated at [04:10]) to finish the fight before the enemy recharges Overcharge themselves."
    },
    {
        "question": "When Lune says 'Celebrate later. There'll be others.' at [06:29], what visual event does this correlate with?",
        "answer": "The speech at [06:29] follows the VICTORY sequence from [06:12] to [06:19]. The correlation: Battle ends → Lune warns celebrations should wait."

        "question": "Explain how the message about Maelle at [06:53] foreshadows the protocol dispute at [07:58].",
        "answer": "The message at [06:53] indicates unusual circumstances. At [07:58], Lune insists on protocol, while Gustave challenges it. The sequence: Strange message → Conflicting protocol interpretations."
    },
    {
        "question": "Track EVEQUE’s charge meter from [03:07] to [06:10].",
        "answer": "Charge readings: 9/10 at [03:07], 10/10 at [04:06], 2/10 at [05:01], 5/10 from [05:56] to [06:10]. Pattern: Build → Max → Reset → Gradual buildup."
